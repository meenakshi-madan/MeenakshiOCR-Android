		<p> Tips for better accuracy:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Avoid blurry images</li>
	<li>Avoid tiny font</li>
	<li>Use better lighting</li>
	<li>Don't use images that are too big</li>
	<li>Avoid clutttered backgrounds</li>
	<li>Leave some empty space around the text while cropping </li>
	<li>This app is not meant to recognize hand-written text and/or very cursive text</li>
	<li>Unless your image is black/white with no noise, and/or you are pressed for time, check the
	"Pre-Processing" option under Settings. This will increase the accuracy</li>
	<li>Although the app deskews the image for you (if you selected "pre-processing" in Settings),
	try to align the image nicely.</li>
	<li>The application learns as you feed it more and more images.</li>
</ul>
