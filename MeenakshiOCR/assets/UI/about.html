pre-processing a selected image, and performing
Optical Character Recognition on it.<br />
The app provides several ways to use this text:-<br />
<ul>
	<li>Copy to clipboard</li>
	<li>Save as text file (.txt)</li>
	<li>Google the text (opens web browser) </li>
	<li>Share with other apps</li>
	<li>Directly send an SMS</li>
</ul>
</p>

<br />
<p>The application also locally stores
the history of the 5 most recent OCR'ed text.
This can be accessed on History screen.</p>
