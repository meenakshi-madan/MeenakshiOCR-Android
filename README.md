MeenakshiOCR-Android
====================

The Android app (apk) component of my TY project

================================================

This app was developed as my semester 6 project of B.Sc. I.T.
The project itself is an Android application which performs Optical Character Recognition on images clicked with the device's built-in camera OR selected from the gallery, displays the text, and lets the user do a bunch of things with this text. I used the Tesseract OCR engine for the OCR part of it, but because the accuracy wasn't very good with a lot of images, I added an image processing library (imagemagick) to the app, figured out a sequence of filters that produced good accuracy by trial and error, and added that as well. The entire UI is a 3D model made from scratch. The reason why I made the entire UI on blender (with very few edits in Gimp) is because of how real and awesome they make the UI look. It has a very robotic, sci-fi-ish feel to it, which is one of my favourite themes.


I also developed a dedicated site for the App using Google app engine. (meenakshi-ocr.appspot.com)
I've made that code open source as well so feel free to browse. (https://github.com/meenakshi-madan/MeenakshiOCR-website)

I've also made the documentation (Black Book) that we had to submit to the college available on the website <a href="http://meenakshi-ocr.appspot.com/public/Black_Book.pdf">here</a>

And finally, the User Manual for the App is <a href="http://meenakshi-ocr.appspot.com/public/UserManual.pdf">here</a>
